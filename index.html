        <p>According to the Cambridge dictionary true crime is books and movies about real crimes that involve real people.  
            True crime can be covered in books, movies, podcasts, and more. 
            Crime happens all around us everyday but it is easy to think that it will never happen to you until it doesâ€¦ 
            Which is why I am creating this website to help people that may being interest in true crime as a topic or want to know more about it to be prepared incase something happens to someone they know and love. 
            This website is a tool used to help people understand crime happening around us, 
            what we can do in a situation where we are the victim/family of the victim, and how we can hopefully try to prevent this from happening to us.</p>
