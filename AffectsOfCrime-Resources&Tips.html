        <h2>How Crime Affects Us</h2>
        <p>There are many cases where families were torn apart or left with so many unanswered questions. Crime affects more than just the family and the victim; it affects the community and the world. 
            It changes everything because friends and family have to find a new way of life without someone that was a very big part of their life. Cases like Alissa Turney caused a rift between her sister 
            Sarah and their dad, Darlene Hulse who was brutally assaulted in front of her young daughters and was then taken from her home and murdered leaving her kids to grow up without a mother, and Lacy 
            Petterson who was pregnant at the time of her disappearance and was then found later in the lake with her baby boy. Cases like these are ones we can never let go because we can either relate to 
            being a sister or a mother but it still seems so different so that is why I have given you some podcasts, resources, and tips to help you.</p>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        
        <p>Here are a few tips to help you prevent or get out of possibly unsafe or dangerous experiences/encounters.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to stay in a group when traveling to avoid being a potential target of kidnapping or abduction.</li>
                <li>If you are at a bar or a party always monitor your drink and never let a stranger know you are alone, just say you are waiting on some friends or your partner.</li>
                <li>You do not have to wait 24 hours to file a report (even if an officer tries to tell you that you do) make someone take the report so that you can get the help you need early on.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Here are some crime junkie life rules(they are pretty helpful):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be weird, be rude, stay alive. Don’t like someone trick you into a bad situation because you were trying to be nice, 
                    it’s ok to be a little rude if someone is pressuring you or making you feel uncomfortable.</li>

                <li>It’s never a mannequin. Usually if you see something on the side of the road that looks like a body it usually is. 
                    Try to stay calm and report it to the police as soon as possible.</li>
                
                <li>Always be aware of your surroundings. Know what is going on around you in case of an emergency. 
                    Being aware helps you to make quick decisions if you ever find yourself in trouble.</li>
                
                <li>You never know anyone ever. Just because someone say they are so-and-so doesn’t mean they are and anyone can hide 
                    sinister intentions – even family.</li>

                <li>If you have a Secret, for the love of god, tell someone. Anyone! It is so important to tell someone – a friend, parent, sibling, or partner 
                    – if there is something going on in your life that has you very of edge and concerned for your safety. Many cases go unsolved because police 
                    are missing one key piece of the puzzle -the secret like someone stalking you, making weird and out of the ordinary comments to you, or threatening you.</li>

                <li>Never Take a Polygraph. They are not admissible in court but police use them to find suspects to look further into.</li>

                <li>An “If I go missing” folder is Essential. This is a file that Ashley and Brit created to help the police and loved ones in case you go missing. 
                    It is a document that has the passwords for your services that could take police weeks to obtain records for. 
                    If you go to the crime junkie podcast website and fill out a form they will email the document to you.</li>

                <li>If you get stopped by an unmarked police car it’s ok to put your flashers on and call the police to verify. 
                    People sometimes pretend to be police to get you to let your guard down and abduct you so it’s ok to be on the 
                    safe side and verify that you are actually being pulled over.</li>

                <li>Don’t Hitchhike. Hitchhiking is the act of getting into a literal strangers car to get to another location. 
                    Don’t do that, that is how people get abducted or kidnapped.</li>

                <li>Always get a Lawyer. You are entitled to representation and in order to make sure police don’t try to take 
                    advantage of your willingness to help.</li>
                
            </ul>
